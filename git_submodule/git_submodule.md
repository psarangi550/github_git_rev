# <ins> How to Create the SubModule using the Git Locally </ins> #

- we can add the `git submodule add` command to add the `sub module` onto the `git` but before that we need to make sure to have the `commits` subdirectory `.git` files 

- to make sure it was successful if there is `.gitmodule` in the root of the `repository`

- this `.gitmodule` is helpful for linking the `main .git` to the submodule `that we created later`

- here we can see the `commit` related to the `main module` but the `submodule` commit we are not able to see in this case 

- if the `submodule` get `out of sync` with the `parent module` then we can do that by using it as `git submodule update` command instead

- `We will learn about the delete the submodule` using the `git submodule delete command `

- while cloning as the submodule we can add as the `git submnodule add <git repo url>` which will clone the repo under the `main parent module` in this case 

- this will create the `submodule as .gitmodule` in
